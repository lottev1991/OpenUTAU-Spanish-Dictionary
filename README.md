# OpenUTAU-Spanish-Dictionary
Spanish Dictionary for [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/openutau), based on the Spanish CMU Pronouncing Dictionary found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Spanish/), albeit with some adjustments.

This dictionary works with my Spanish Syllable-based Phonemizer.
