# OpenUTAU Spanish Dictionary
Spanish Dictionary for [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/openutau), based on the Spanish CMU Pronouncing Dictionary found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Spanish/), albeit with some adjustments.

This dictionary works with my Spanish Syllable-based Phonemizer, as well as the Spanish-to-Japanese Phonemizer which I also created.

Special thanks to Teren000 for help!
